# Collaborative-Shopping-E-commerce-Website
 Standard e-commerce websites show similar audience interaction with minimal differences.
E-commerce websites have been there since long now. With time they have evolved very well and offer a lot of functionalities such as filtering products, offering products from a wide range of categories, prime features like express delivery and so on.
We also have domain focused websites like Myntra, who focus only on clothes. 
Now developers try to find new problems and perspectives to this domain and try to solve the problems or limitations. We dropped in a real-life situation and tried to implement it on an online website.
To introduce it in a line, this service allows multiple users to interact together in multiple ways and have a shopping experience together.
